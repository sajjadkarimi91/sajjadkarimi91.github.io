<p class="qtrr-intro">
  The heart’s electrical recovery adapts gradually to changes in heart rate. This delay
  creates distinct QT–RR and T-wave amplitude–RR paths during exercise and recovery.
  Explore these dynamics in the synchronized plots below. Our research uses personalized
  models to characterize this adaptation and improve detection of prior myocardial
  infarction.

<p class="qtrr-intro qtrr-note">
  <strong>What is on this page:</strong> recorded data only. Two de-identified stress-test
  recordings are played back beat by beat, and every curve below is measured from those
  recordings. The personalized models described in the papers are a separate step in the
  research: they are driven by a <em>standardized</em> heart-rate input so that responses
  can be compared across people. No model-generated response appears here.

  <summary>Methods &amp; data</summary>

  <p>Two de-identified single-lead Holter recordings from a cardiac stress test, each
  covering the ten minutes either side of peak heart rate. Time is abstract — there are
  no dates or clock offsets. ECG is baseline-corrected and decimated to 100&nbsp;Hz.</p>

  <p>Beat detection, quality filtering and robust outlier rejection were applied upstream;
  the page plots what it is given and does not re-filter. The <em>smoothed</em> series
  driving the loops is a 41-beat centred moving mean, so it uses beats either side of the
  current one and is not a causal, real-time estimate. Between beats the smoothed series
  is linearly interpolated so the point glides; raw per-beat values are never interpolated.</p>

  <p>Marker positions come from the delineator's sample indices on a 10&nbsp;ms grid, while
  the QT and T-amplitude figures quoted are the source measurements. The two disagree
  slightly by construction — reconstructing QT from the marked endpoints differs from the
  measured QT by up to 8&nbsp;ms. Where the delineator gave no point, or returned landmarks
  out of order, the T markers and QT shading for that beat are suppressed rather than
  repaired; the beat still contributes to the smoothed loops.</p>

  <p>The <em>averaged beats</em> view takes every beat within &plusmn;30&nbsp;s of the current
  moment, aligns them on the R-peak and averages them. Each curve spans &minus;25&nbsp;% to
  +75&nbsp;% of the average RR of the minute it sits in, so it ends three quarters of the
  way through the cycle. That keeps the next beat out of the average: always its QRS, and
  its P wave too wherever diastole is long enough. Near peak heart rate it is not &mdash;
  there the T wave itself runs past where the next P wave begins, so the two genuinely
  overlap and no choice of window can separate them.</p>

  <p>The time axis is locked for the whole record at the largest smoothed RR,
  so curves stay comparable from the first to the last; a curve recorded at a fast heart
  rate is simply shorter. Earlier curves stay on screen in grey, and the T-peak and T-end
  markers are drawn in green so they read against the orange, the blue and the grey
  alike.</p>

  <p>Exercise is shown in orange, recovery in blue, split at peak heart rate.</p>

  <p><strong>Recorded, not modelled.</strong> Everything drawn on this page is measured
  from the two recordings: the beats, the intervals, the loops and the averaged beats are
  all observed data from a real stress test. The research goes a step further and fits a
  personalized model per participant, then drives every model with the same standardized
  rest&ndash;exercise&ndash;recovery heart-rate input so that the resulting responses are
  comparable between people and can be used as features for classification. Those
  standardized, model-generated responses are described in the papers below and are not
  shown here.</p>
